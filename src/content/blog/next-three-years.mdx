import Link from "../../components/Link.vue";
import Code from "../../components/Code.vue";
import { createHeading } from "../../components/Heading";

export const components = {
  a: Link,
  code: Code,
  h1: createHeading("h1"),
  h2: createHeading("h2"),
  h3: createHeading("h3"),
};

Money can provide opportunities and comfort, yet breed complacency. At age 21, I have achieved little, but the future remains full of potential.

While self-improvement is important,  nothing surpasses success shared with friends. I am fortunate to have a group striving for progress in their own pursuits, reminding me to savor the journey, not just the destination.

My goals are simple:
- To become a better person, with each day's experiences.
- To grow as a software engineer, for I know I have far to go.
- To help family and friends, making a positive impact.

Here's to making progress, one step at a time. ðŸ¥‚
